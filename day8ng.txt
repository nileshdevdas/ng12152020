1. Type of app for mobility 
	can a angular app be converted to  a mobile app 

	yes the angular was designed to work for mobile first fundamental 
	
	Multiple  Formfactors with one single code base 
	example :    1 : can i design for the andriod 
		2: can i design for the ios 
		3.  can i design for the browser 
		4.  can i design for the tabs 
	single code : 
	a) Responsive coding 
	b) Wrap up  
		Cordova (PhoneGap) / Ionic
		WebView 

	html5 and he taking a angular and wrapping inside andrioud / webpage 
	native --> gyrometer -> gps --> local storage / camera 

	advantage : ios / android / for normal application the code base remains same 
	there is absolutely no change in the code execpt the build strategy 


a) How do i build the angular : 
	ng build --prod  (i am really using the production) code 
	when angular ---> prod it mimized the codee 
	whatthebigvaribalename ----> 1_1c1
	convert these into a single single --> unit small chunks of code size of your code 
	is reduced drastically ---> where is the key x = y
	tha file is generated by the webpack that key file is know the .map 
	when you choose the mode as --->   prod the map file is skipped you dont want to show your 
	client the code what you have written 

	yes i wish to do the debug 
	yes i wish to travese the code 

	i would definitely want the code to be clearly not visible in prod
	
	
	for production i always do a build with ng build --prod 
	for uat /dev  ng build /// with prod 

This same fundamental applies cordova 

Step me 

npm install -g cordova

allows you to create cordova wrapper apps 
Cordova is a wrapper over the application --> You have built
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cordova create myapp  com.vinsys.demo mydemo

Can i bundle my application with  mobile :- which written in angular : 

Yes : Cordova 

a)  npm install -g cordova 
b)  create a small cordova application : 
	cordova  create  testapp  com.siemens.apps.demo  App1

c)   Do you wish to add any platforms 
	cordova  platform add android 
	cordova  platform add browser 
d)   now build your application and copy it content to the www folder of your cordova application 
	ng build --prod --base-href .  --output-path d:/smapp/www 
	you ng builds output now goes into the folder 
e)    in the www / in the genarated file d:/smapp/www/index.html  you will need to add the 
	cordova.js  scirpt 
	
	<script type="text/javascript"   src="cordova.js"></script>
f)    cordova run <platform>

ng test 
Test Driven Development (T-D-D) 

A test driven development works with a combination of things : 
first we write test and then we write code 

a) Test Gives Understanding of what i want to write 
b) Test gives me the code coverage 
c)  test allows me to do impact analysis 
d)  test calculates time taken by eash test case 
e)  test  combined allows me to measure the overy build quality and failure reasons 
f)   test reduces testing time 
g)  tests allows me to do automation 
h)  test allows me to control  the versioning / tracking is easier 
i)   elementary defect conditional scenraios are already handled before it reaches outside world 
====================================================================================
in angular unit testing is by default enable because every component , eveyr service or every pipe or guard 
or whatever you create it creates a common structure : which is   spec file 
The spec is the unit test case 


What would you want to test on test 
	component --> should have must have will have ---> 
	expected v/s actual values i the test case a human can write 
	i expected a element to be present when i click abutton 
	i expected a popup when i did this 
	i expected a exception and got this --> 
	conditions that you wish to test 
	
	We call them as assertions : - 
	the assertion fails means the test has failed. ... 



The overall test driven activites can be done with angular
